    Hello Folks Thanku to giving me your costly time to read this article
    so it will take 4 to 5 minute to read this so lets enjoy





##  What Is NoSQL ?
     . We know that MongoDB is a NoSQL Database, so it is very necessary to know about NoSQL Database to understand MongoDB throughly.
     
     
##  How It Works ?

     . Data stored in a NoSQL Database is not related to each other i.e. every record is independent of each other. 
     
     . Changes made in a particular record do not affect the value of another record. 
     
     . It is an alternative to SQL Databases where data is stored in Tables with a fixed Database Schema.
     
     . NoSQL Databases aren’t required to follow any predefined Relational Schema i.e. they are Schemaless. 
     
     . This means that the records in a NoSQL Database do not need to have the same structure. Each record can be completely different from one another.
     
##  Examples of NoSQL databases for each category ?

     . column based database.
     
     . Document-Oriented NoSQL DB stores.
     
     . retrieves data as a key value pair but the value part is stored as a document.

## Why  NoSQL  are important ?

     . If your organization is dealing with massive amounts of unstructured data and your data requirements aren’t clear at the outset, you probably don’t have the            luxury of developing a relational database with a clearly defined schema.
     
     . In these cases use NoSQL databases, you will get much more flexibility than its traditional counterparts. Let’s discuss 5 important features of NoSQL databases.        It will give you a clear picture when to use it…
     
     . NoSQL is a non-relational database that is used to store the data in the nontabular form.
     
     . NoSQL stands for Not only SQL.


##  Types Of Nosql ?

    . Document-based databases.
    
    . Key-value stores.
    
    . Column-oriented databases.
    
    . Graph-based databases.


## Advantage of NoSQL ?
    . It supports query language.

    . It provides fast performance.

    . It provides horizontal scalability.

## Drawback of NoSQL ?
    . Immature and Less Support.

    . Scalability.

    . Lack of Consistency.
